  -IN DAY O1 What we achieved:
  
Defined the type of marketplace

Identified our target audience

Clarified the problems we aim to solve

Outlined the products/services we'll offer

Highlighted what makes our marketplace unique

Designed a data schema

Mapped the relationships between entities


 -IN DAY O2
 
Day 2 task, which revolved around planning and strategizing the technical foundation of our project. During this phase, we focused on:

Defining technical requirements for a robust project.

Designing the system architecture for scalability and efficiency.

Planning the API requirements to ensure seamless data integration.

Day 3:

This was an incredible learning experience! Here's what we achieved:

✔ Implemented the API schema and migration script provided by our faculty.

✔ Integrated the schema into Sanity for seamless content management.

✓ Fetched data from the API, stored it in Sanity, and retrieved it for the UI.

✔ Designed a clean and user-friendly frontend interface.

✓ Effectively handled errors and ensured smooth functionality.

✓ Explored and learned so much more throughout the process.


DAY 04;

•Key Highlights of Day 4:

•Designed and implemented a Product Listing Component with dynamic data rendering.

•Built a detailed Product Detail Page with dynamic routing for enhanced user navigation.

•Added a functional Search Bar for real-time product filtering.

•Integrated advanced Category and Filter Components for seamless product segmentation.

•Ensured all components are modular, responsive, and user-friendly.

Tools & Technologies:

1:Sanity CMS: Efficient data management and fetching.

2:Next.js: For dynamic routing and component-based architecture.

3:Tailwind CSS: To ensure responsive and aesthetic designs.

DAY 05;

#KeyHighlights:

-Functional Testing: Thoroughly tested navigation, product pages, cart functionality, and checkout processes to ensure flawless performance.

-Error Management: Implemented fallback strategies for API failures and set up centralized error logging to streamline debugging.

-Performance Optimization: Improved PageSpeed, optimized API response times, introduced lazy loading, and implemented caching strategies for faster page loads.

-Cross-Device Testing: Ensured the platform is responsive across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile devices.

-User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Refined the user journey by incorporating real-world feedback, especially focusing on cart adjustments and checkout.

DAY 06 AND DAY 07;

Replicate Production Environment

Infrastructure: Ensure that your staging environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. This includes the same server configurations, database setup, and software versions.

• Third-Party Integrations

APIs and Webhooks: Test any third-party integrations (shipping, inventory management, marketing tools etc.) to ensure they work correctly in staging.

• User Authentication

Login & Authorization: Test the login process, including single sign-on (SSO) or any other forms of authentication, in the staging environment.

• Testing

Functional Testing: Perform manual and

automated tests on user journeys-searching for products, adding them to the cart, checking out, etc.

• Security Testing: Run vulnerability scans using tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus to identify and address any potential security weaknesses.
Environment Configuration

Environment Variables: Use different configuration files for your staging environment for database connections, API keys, Tools like dotenv or similar can help manage environment variables securely.

• Backup & Rollback Plan

Backups: Ensure that you have a backup strategy for both the database and application. If anything goes wrong during deployment, you can quickly roll back to a stable version.

This setup ensures everything works smoothly in staging before going live! Let me know if you need more details on any of these steps.
